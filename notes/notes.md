Reactive iOS App Development
Apple offers the KVO (Key-Value-Observation) framework as a way to make apps reactive to model property changes, but this technology is far from comprehensive enough to serve all of the needs of a modern application developer. We'll discuss how using Realm for iOS gives us the benefits of a truly reactive paradigm in mobile development and allows us to decouple our application logic from our API layer, creating a much cleaner application architecture that lends itself to more seamless on/offline experiences.

Christopher is a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft working for App Center (formerly at Xamarin). Though currently working as a full stack developer, he has a background in native mobile development with a focus in iOS, and knows just enough about machine learning to be dangerous. When not coding, he is most often coding. He also enjoys playing guitar to the tune of progressive metal and symphonic rock.
