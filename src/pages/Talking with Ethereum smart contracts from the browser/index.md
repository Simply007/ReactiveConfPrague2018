* Intro to blockchain technology
* Showcases on Ethereum
* Solidity

* Solidity example
  * used to write the code for blockchain - similar syntax to javascript
* Ethereum
  * more data to database the more money it costs

# Use case
* use Ganache for local Ethereum code
* **use case**: domain registration service that stores data in the local node 
  * example how to implement the domain service using `web3` npm package for connection to the contract to the domain service using the json and bytecode implementation
    * showcase how does the `json` with contract looks like using to communicate though the contract
    * contract with connection with bytecode is possible to use to calling the contract methods
* note that it is useful to use events for all peers notice that some change has happened
