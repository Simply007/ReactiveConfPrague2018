* Nice source of information https://material.io/design/motion/
    * not everything should be used universally 


# Intro
* how does the brains and eyes process animation/movement - smooth pursuit
    * moving head and try to stick by eyes is hard
    * moving hand and stick it with your exes - movement look smoother - **focus on that**
* how does the brain optimize animations process tasks
    * creating the average between two or more vectors 
    * global motion perception

# How to apply intro
* create one smooth animation, do not split them (i.e. when loading list of items)
* loader - catch all the user focus from the background
* spacial navigation
* vestibular disorder
    * animation nig part of the screen
    * big rotation
    * long transitions

# Tools
* React Morf
* React Pose
* Popcorn
